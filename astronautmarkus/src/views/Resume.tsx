                      I specialize in full-stack development derived more from the use of back-end technologies such as Flask, Node.js and Python, I also use front-end technologies such as Bootstrap, Bulma, and some others.

                      In addition to programming, I enjoy working on hardware projects, such as assembling servers or computer components, and from time to time I do some systems administration. I consider that each small step has helped me gain more experiences in other sectors, combining everything and achieving much better solutions, like this page!

                      I started programming at 19, my main aspirations were to develop a video game, which I still have in mind to do. I studied at <a href="https://www.duoc.cl/" className="text-glow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duoc UC</a>, where I met great people, classmates and teachers, who helped shape who I am now. As these years went by, I learned different facets of programming, which helped me understand more how things in our daily lives work.

                    <p>
                    In my social ties I was always the "computer guy", when we were students I used to be the one who created the "servers" for multiplayer video games together, I have always had that "natural talent" with computers, now that I am a developer fullstack I can make the most of my skills.
